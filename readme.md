# Unsupervised Dependency Parsing with DMV

**NOT IMPLEMENTED YET**

The code is an implementation of Dan Klein's DMV model ( named "**Dependency Model with Valence**", `ACL-2004` ) and the neural version proposed by Yong Jiang( `EMNLP-2016`  ).

## Requirements
*See `pom.xml` for details*
- Java 1.8 (or higher)
- Kotlin 1.1 (or higher)
- DeepLearning4J 0.9.1 (or higher)
- ND4J 0.9.1 (or higher)
